We need a typeclass for conversions.
It converts left hand side arguments
Declarations
right hand side arguments


Does not correctly process arguments in gen blocks
Does not correctly process arguments in module declarations. 
Put the sensitivity list in the pipeline statement. 

Pipeline argument should define the sensitivity list.
Variable Argument should be an integer or name.
initialize is not properly processing variables. 
Use variable names defined in the input output interface. 

if a variable and a function share the
  same name in your codebase, we'd skip validating the function reference. But that's a very narrow
  case.


Also, there are 3 basic design patterns that I'm aware of for building pipelines, there may be others. Using Spinal naming here. 

Registers: data only, your case
Flow: valid+data
Stream: valid+ready+data


I think I need pipeline and end pipelinekeywords
pipeline(Registers)
pipeline(Flow)
pipeline(Stream) 

Suggest you add verilator with the  lint option to the output of your tool.
