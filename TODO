Does not correctly process arguments in module declarations. 

if a variable and a function share the
  same name in your codebase, we'd skip validating the function reference. But that's a very narrow
  case.


Also, there are 3 basic design patterns that I'm aware of for building pipelines, there may be others. Using Spinal naming here. 

Registers: data only, your case
Flow: valid+data
Stream: valid+ready+data


pipeline(Registers)
pipeline(Flow)
pipeline(Stream) 

Suggest you add verilator with the  lint option to the output of your tool.
